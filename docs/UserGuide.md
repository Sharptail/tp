<a name="customer"></a>
- <details open class="customer">
    <summary class="dropdown-2">Customer</summary>

    <a name="customer-list"></a>
    - <details open>
        <summary class="dropdown-3">List all customers - <code>list</code></summary>

        Format:
         ```
         customer list
         ```

         The above command would list all the customers in the left column in the GUI.

        </details>

        <a name="customer-add"></a>
    - <details open>
        <summary class="dropdown-3">Add a customer - <code>add</code></summary>

        Format:
         ```
         customer add n/[NAME] p/[PHONE] e/[EMAIL] a/[ADDRESS] (t/[TAG])
         ```

        Example:
         ```
         customer add n/Alan Tan p/81236789 e/alantan@nus.edu.sg a/21 Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore 119077 t/Gluten Allergy
         ```

        The above command would add a new contact named "Alan Tan" with phone number 81236789, email address "alantan@nus.edu.sg",
        address "Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore 119077" and tagged with "Gluten Allergy".

        </details>

        <a name="customer-delete"></a>
    - <details open>
        <summary class="dropdown-3">Delete customer - <code>delete</code></summary>

        Format:
        ```
        customer delete [INDEX] (-f)
        ```

        In the event that there are uncompleted orders by the contact that is being attempted to be deleted, a `-f` flag has to be added to the end of the command to confirm the command. This is to prevent you from accidentally deleting orders unknowingly and leading to unhappy customers!

        Examples:
        ```
        customer delete 2
        ```

        The above command would delete the second customer on the customer information pane.

        ```
        customer delete 2 -f
        ```

        In the event that there are pending orders that have not been fulfilled that belong to customer 2, then deletion of the customer will not be allowed since we do not want to unknowingly delete orders that are still pending.
        If deleting all orders, even pending ones, is desired, then adding the `-f` at the end of the command acknowledges and confirms the deletion behavior.

        </details>

        <a name="customer-edit"></a>
    - <details open>
        <summary class="dropdown-3">Edit customer information - <code>edit</code></summary>

        ```
        customer edit [INDEX] (n/[NAME]) (p/[PHONE]) (e/[EMAIL]) (a/[ADDRESS]) (t/[TAG])
        ```

        At least one of the fields in brackets must be present in the edit command.

        Examples:

        ```
        customer edit 2 n/George Tan
        ```

        The above command changes the name of the second customer on the contacts pane to "George Tan".

        ```
        customer edit 2 n/George Tan p/80009999
        ```

        The above command changes both the name and phone number of the second customer.

        From the examples above, more than one field can be edited at a time but at least 1 field must be specified for it to be a valid command.

        Format:
        ```
        customer find n/[KEYWORD] (MORE_KEYWORDS)...
        ```

        - `n/` - Finds all customers whose names contain any of the keywords (case-insensitive). Keywords are space separated.

        Example:
        ```
        customer find n/George Michael Lim
        ```

        The above command would display all contacts with names that contain either "George", "Michael", or "Lim". Note that at least 1 keyword must be specified, `customer find n/Thomas` is a valid command too with only 1 keyword ("Thomas").

        menu list (-a)
        ```
        To show the current available dishes only, a `-a` flag has to be added to the end of the command.
        Examples:
        ```
        menu list
        ```

        The above command would display all dishes disregard the availability of the dish.

        ```

        ```

        In the event that there are uncompleted orders by the dishes that is being attempted to be deleted, a `-f` flag
        has to be added to the end of the command to confirm the command. This is to prevent you from accidentally
        deleting orders unknowingly and leading to unhappy customers!

        Examples:

        The above command would delete the second dishes on the menu information pane.

        ```

        ```

        In the event that there are pending orders that have not been fulfilled that contains dish id 2, then deletion
        of the dish will not be allowed since we do not want to unknowingly delete orders that are still pending.
        If deleting any dishes that belongs to any uncompleted order is desired, then adding the `-f` at the
