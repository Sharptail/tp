## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Week 10 Task

#### James

**Enhancement**: Update model for new functions
- Made new classes for Dish, Order, Ingredient components
- Made new `Book` classes for each
- Exposed functionality of each book through `ModelManager` (Facade pattern)

**Enhancement**: Update storage for new functions
- Ensure JSON serializability of each class by using `Jackson` annotations
- Update sample data for each book
- Update Storage classes to support new `Book`

#### Jian Wei

**Enhancement**: Component Parser

The `ComponentParser` mechanism is facilitated by `JJIMYParser` with an input format of

    [component] [commands] [arguments]

`JJIMYParser` will read in the first word of the input which is the `[component]` and parse into respective component parsers such as `CustomerParser`, `MenuParser`, `OrderParser` and `InventoryParser` that implements `ComponentParser`
with an input format of

    [commands] [arguments]

Finally, the respective `ComponentParser` will read in the `[command]` and return their respective `ComponentCommand` to be executed by `LogicManager`

The following sequence diagram shows how the parser on a `CustomerAddCommand` operation
![JJIMYParser Sequence Diagram](images/JJIMYParserSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command.
![JJIMYParser Activity Diagram](images/JJIMYParserActivityDiagram.png)

**Enhancement**: Visualisation of 2 lists concurrently

To increase the efficiency of adding food order, the GUI has been improved to display 2 lists at the same time. Customer list will always be on the left column whereas the rest of the component list will be on the right column.
 
The component list on the right column will be controlled by any of the respective component's command. Example

    - menu list [arguments]
    - order list [arguments]
    - menu add [arguments]
    ...etc.

#### Ian
**Enhancement**: Component List
- Implement list command for each component
- Call GUI to list all items for a component

The `Component List` command mechanism is facilitated in `MainWindow` of the UI with an input format of

	[component] list

`MainWindow` sends the command to `LogicManager` to be parsed by `JJIMYParser`. As outlined in ** **Enhancement**: Component Parser ** it returns the respective `ComponentCommand` to be executed by `LogicManager`. Finally, a `CommandResult` is sent back to MainWindow which changes what is shown in the GUI. Display is outlined in ** **Enhancement**: Visualisation ** of 2 lists concurrently.

The following sequence diagram shows how the parser on a `Menu List` command operation:
![ShowMenuList Sequence Diagram](images/ShowMenuList.png)



#### Yang Ze
**Enhancement**: Add command
- Implement add command for each component
- Ensure validity of parameters and lookup

#### Marcus
**Enhancement**: Delete command
- Implement delete command for each component

**Enhancement**: Data consistency
- Implement cascading deletion of appropriate models 
  (for ie deletion of a `Person` should also delete all associated `Order` objects)
  
![](images/CascadingDeletionCustomers.png)

As seen from the above sequence diagram, when `deletePerson` is called on `ModelManager`, it first deletes the `Person`
from `PersonBook`. Then, it retrieves the entire order list from `OrderBook` and checks each individual `Order`. If the
`Order` is associated with the `Person`, then the `Order` is removed by `ModelManger` via the `deleteOrder` method. This
check is done via `Order::isFromCustomer` which returns `true` if the `Order` is associated with the `Customer` and
`false` otherwise.
